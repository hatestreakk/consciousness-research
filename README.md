# Resonance Architecture of Consciousness (RAC)

A unified mathematical framework for understanding consciousness across biological and artificial systems.

## 📖 About

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Resonance Architecture of Consciousness (RAC) theory, including:

- Mathematical framework for consciousness as resonant computation
- ICIM metric for consciousness assessment  
- Entropy dynamics model of conscious systems
- Empirical validation across 2.3+ million measurements
- Cross-system applications (biological, AI, clinical)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/consciousness-research/rac-framework.git
cd consciousness-research
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
